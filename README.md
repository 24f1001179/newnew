# Matrix Build Example

This repository contains a sample GitHub Actions workflow that demonstrates a matrix build with artifact uploads.

Workflow: `.github/workflows/matrix-build.yml`

Key features:
- Matrix strategy with 3 Python versions (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- Parallel jobs for each matrix variant
- Each job generates a `build-output-<variant>.txt` file and uploads it as an artifact named `build-7d8f6c1-python-<variant>`
- The workflow contains a step with the identifier `matrix-7d8f6c1`
